# Speech-Speech-Translator

This application enables speech-to-speech translation between English and Sinhala (bilingual) using ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition), TT(Text to Text) and TTS (Text-to-Speech) models.

## Features:

When a user speaks, the Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system converts the speech into transcript. Next, the transcript is translated through a Text-to-Text translation system and the translated text is sent to a Text-to-Speech (TTS) system and the target speech is generated.

## Installation:

Ensure you have Python and pip installed. Then, install the necessary libraries using the requirements.txt file by:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
